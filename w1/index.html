            Hello, my name is <u>Devin Rivera</u>. I am currently enrolled at <b>New England Institute of Techhnology</b> in the Cybersecurity & Network Engineering program. I 
            have been interested in computers almost my <i>entire</i> life. It all started about 4 years ago when I had built my first ever computer. The build alone costed over
            <b>$1000</b> but I could confidently say that I built that computer to the best of my ability.
